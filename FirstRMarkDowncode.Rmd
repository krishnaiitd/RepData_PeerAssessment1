My First R Markdown file
========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here, we're going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, Solar.R radiation and Temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <-lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data =airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:

* First element

* Second element

Here is a code chunk
```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```
